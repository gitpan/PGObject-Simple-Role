PGObject-Simple-Role

PGObject::Simple::Role is a role implementation of the PGObject::Simple 
functionality aimed at cases where the quick and dirty approach is not idea.

PGObject::Simple::Role is a Moo role which allows you to use this functionality
in Moo and Moose environments.  The role itself makes no assumptions about 
database state, but provides hooks for classes to use to retrieve or create
database handles for their use.

This module is suited to quick and easy integration of PostgreSQL stored
procedures with Moo and Moose object models.  It is quite powerful and it makes
developing in such environments relatively easy.
