TODO for 1.0:

1.  Get has_dbmethod working and with a stable API. 
    Basically move to PGObject::Utils::DBMethod with an export.

2.  Add contextual return support.

3.  Handle lazy attributes.  This will require *not* going through 
    PGObject::Simple in order to handle this properly.  OTOH, this will likely
    be a general good thing.
